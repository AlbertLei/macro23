# Testing quarto

I have individual files that I want to render with Quarto,
as Pandoc has better support for TeX.

For example, this `index.qmd` is at
`content/test-quarto/index.qmd`.
I can generate the corresponding `index.md` file by running:

```bash
quarto render content/test-quarto/index.qmd
```

## Math and code highhight

```python
import numpy as np
np.array(1)
```

\mu_0 \in \supp \Delta \Omega
