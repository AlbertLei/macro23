My themeless hugo template for small websites

Some design choices

- I hate to write all the yaml info at the beginning of every webpage. This template should work fine for plain md files with no title/time/author/... info at all.

- The two layouts, default and listing, are the same except the "Back to Index" footer of the listing layout. No blogging indeed.

- CSS are mainly copied from the pandoc.css, except the code/pre css style which are inconsistent with Hugo code highlight.

- The output dir is changed to docs, so easy to publish with github page.
